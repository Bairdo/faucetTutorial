Routing Tutorial
================

This tutorial will cover routing with Faucet.

There are three types of routing we can use.
- Inter VLAN routing
- Static routing
- BGP via an external application (Quagga, Bird, EXABGP, ...)

Prerequisites:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Faucet `Steps 1 & 2 <https://faucet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html#package-installation>`_
- OpenVSwitch `Steps 1 & 2 <https://faucet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html#connect-your-first-datapath>`_
- Useful Bash Functions (`create_ns <_static/tutorial/create_ns>`_, `as_ns <_static/tutorial/as_ns>`_, `cleanup <_static/tutorial/cleanup>`_)


Routing between VLANs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's start with a single switch connected to two hosts in two different vlans.

.. image:: _static/images/vlan-routing.svg
    :alt: vlan routing diagram

Run the cleanup script to remove old namespaces and switches:

.. code:: console

    cleanup


.. code:: console

    create_ns host1 10.0.0.254/24
    create_ns host2 10.0.1.254/24
    sudo ovs-vsctl add-br br1 \
    -- set bridge br1 other-config:datapath-id=0000000000000001 \
    -- set bridge br1 other-config:disable-in-band=true \
    -- set bridge br1 fail_mode=secure \
    -- add-port br1 veth-host1 -- set interface veth-host1 ofport_request=2 \
    -- add-port br1 veth-host2 -- set interface veth-host2 ofport_request=3 \
    -- set-controller br1 tcp:127.0.0.1:6653 tcp:127.0.0.1:6654


To allow traffic between vlans we use a router, and assign each VLAN at least one IP address (gateway IP address).
Lets add the routers and vlans section like so.

.. code:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml

    vlans:
        vlan100:
            vid: 100
            faucet_vips: ["10.0.0.254/24"]  # Faucet's virtual IP address for vlan100
        vlan200:
            vid: 200
            faucet_vips: ["10.0.1.254/24"]  # Faucet's virtual IP address for vlan200

    routers:
        router-1:                           # Router name
            vlans: [vlan100, vlan200]       # names of vlans to allow routing between.

    dps:
        sw1:
            dp_id: 0x1
            hardware: "Open vSwitch"
            interfaces:
                1:
                    name: "host1"
                    description: "host1 network namespace"
                    native_vlan: vlan100
                2:
                    name: "host2"
                    description: "host2 network namespace"
                    native_vlan: vlan200

Send SIGHUP signal to reload the configuration file.

.. code:: console

    sudo pkill -HUP -f "faucet\.faucet"

Add the default route to the 'faucet_vips' as above.

.. code:: console
    as_ns host1 ip route add default via 10.0.0.254 dev veth0
    as_ns host2 ip route add default via 10.0.1.254 dev veth0

Then generate some traffic between our two hosts.

.. code:: console
    as_ns host1 ping 10.0.1.2

It should work and traffic should go through.


Static Routing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this we will setup a Faucet switch with three hosts.
One of these hosts will act like a gateway,

.. image:: _static/images/static-routing.svg
    :alt: static routing network diagram

Run the cleanup script to remove old namespaces and switches.

.. code:: console
    cleanup


Create 3 hosts, in 2 diffferent subnets:

.. code:: console

    create_ns host1 10.0.0.1/24
    create_ns host2 10.0.0.2/24
    create_ns hostgw 10.0.1.3/24


And add a default route for each host to it's gateway router.

.. code:: console

    as_ns host1 ip route add default via 10.0.0.254
    as_ns host2 ip route add default via 10.0.0.254
    as_ns hostgw ip route add default via 10.0.1.254


Create the bridge and add hosts 1, 2 and the gw to br1.

.. code:: console

    sudo ovs-vsctl add-br br1 \
    -- set bridge br1 other-config:datapath-id=0000000000000001 \
    -- set bridge br1 other-config:disable-in-band=true \
    -- set bridge br1 fail_mode=secure \
    -- add-port br1 veth-host1 -- set interface veth-host1 ofport_request=1 \
    -- add-port br1 veth-host2 -- set interface veth-host2 ofport_request=2 \
    -- add-port br1 veth-hostgw -- set interface veth-hostgw ofport_request=3 \
    -- set-controller br1 tcp:127.0.0.1:6653 tcp:127.0.0.1:6654


For this Faucet configuration we will start from scratch.
First we need to define 2 VLANs.
1. hosts.
2. gw.

Here we have 3 new options:

- faucet_mac: The MAC address of Faucet's routing interface on this VLAN.
If we do not set faucet_mac for each VLAN, routed packets will be dropped unless 'drop_spoofed_faucet_mac' is set to false.
TODO explain above more.
- faucet_vips: The IP address for Faucet's routing interface on this VLAN.
Multiple IP addresses (IPv4 & IPv6) can be used.
- routes: Static routes for this VLAN.


.. code:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml

    vlans:
        br1-hosts:
            vid: 100
            description: "h1 & h2's vlan"
            faucet_mac: "00:00:00:00:00:11"
            faucet_vips: ["10.0.0.254/24"]

        br1-gw:
            vid: 200
            description: "vlan for gw port"
            faucet_mac: "00:00:00:00:00:22"
            faucet_vips: ["10.0.1.254/24"]
            routes:
                - route:
                    ip_dst: "0.0.0.0/24"
                    ip_gw: '10.0.1.3/24'

As our routing interface is in a different VLAN, we will want to route between the two VLANs on the switch (br1-hosts & br1-peer).
So as with inter VLAN routing we will create a router for each switch.

.. code:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml

    routers:
        router-br1:
            vlans: [br1-hosts, br1-gw]

And the rest of the config looks like this:

.. code:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml

    dps:
        br1:
            dp_id: 0x1
            hardware: "Open vSwitch"
            interfaces:
                1:
                    name: "host1"
                    description: "host1 network namespace"
                    native_vlan: br1-hosts
                2:
                    name: "host2"
                    description: "host2 network namespace"
                    native_vlan: br1-hosts
                3:
                    name: "gw:"
                    description: "hostgw network namespace"
                    native_vlan: br1-gw


Start/reload Faucet.

.. code:: console

    sudo systemctl restart faucet


and we should now be able to ping (the first few packets may get lost as ?arp? does it's thing).

.. code:: console

    as_ns host1 ping 10.0.1.3
    PING 10.0.1.3 (10.0.1.3) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 10.0.1.3: icmp_seq=2 ttl=62 time=0.625 ms
    64 bytes from 10.0.1.3: icmp_seq=3 ttl=62 time=0.133 ms
    64 bytes from 10.0.1.3: icmp_seq=4 ttl=62 time=0.064 ms
    64 bytes from 10.0.1.3: icmp_seq=5 ttl=62 time=0.090 ms

BGP Routing
^^^^^^^^^^^

For this section we are going to change our static routes from above into BGP routes.

BGP (and other routing) is provided by a NFV service, here we will use [BIRD](http://bird.network.cz/).
Other applications such as ExaBGP & Quagga could be used.
Faucet imports all routes provided by this NVF service.
This means we can use our service for other routing protocols (OSPF, RIP, etc) and apply filtering using the serivce's policy langague.
See [routing-2](routing-2.rst) for more advanced BGP route filtering.

If you are NOT using the workshop VM you will need to install BIRD.

To install BIRD:

.. code:: console

    apt-get install bird


Our dataplane will end up looking like this:

.. image:: _static/images/bgp-dataplane.svg
    :alt: BGP network diagram

Note 1:
When using BGP and Faucet, if changing Faucet's routing configuration (routers, static routes, or a VLAN's BGP config) the Faucet application must be restarted to reload the configuration correctly (not sighup reloaded).

Remove the static routes added above:

.. code:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml

    vlans:
        br1-hosts:
            vid: 100
            description: "h1 & h2's vlan"
            faucet_mac: "00:00:00:00:00:11"
            faucet_vips: ["10.0.0.254/24"]

        br1-gw:
            vid: 200
            description: "vlan for peering port"
            faucet_mac: "00:00:00:00:00:22"
            faucet_vips: ["10.0.1.254/24"]

    routers:
        router-br1:
            vlans: [br1-hosts, br1-gw]

    dps:
        br1:
            dp_id: 0x1
            hardware: "Open vSwitch"
            interfaces:
                1:
                    name: "host1"
                    description: "host1 network namespace"
                    native_vlan: br1-hosts

                2:
                    name: "host2"
                    description: "host2 network namespace"
                    native_vlan: br1-hosts
                3:
                    name: "gw"
                    description: "hostgw network namespace"
                    native_vlan: br1-gw

Reload Faucet

.. code:: console
    TODO does sighup work here?


And check that host1 can ping host2 but not the gw.

.. code:: console

    as_ns host1 ping 10.0.0.2
    as_ns host1 ping 10.0.1.3


Next we will add Faucet to our switch's dataplane so that it can communicate with the BGP speaking hostgw.

.. image:: _static/images/bgp-routing-ns.svg
    :alt: BGP Routing Namespace Diagram

.. code:: console

    ip link add veth-faucet0 type veth peer name veth-faucet-dp
    ovs-vsctl add-port br1 veth-faucet-dp -- set interface veth-faucet-dp ofport_request=4
    ip addr add 10.0.1.2/24 dev veth-faucet0


To configure BIRD

.. code:: conf
    :caption: /etc/bird.conf

    protocol kernel {
        scan time 60;
        import none;
    }

    protocol device {
        scan time 60;
    }

    # Local
    # TODO is this right?
    protocol static {
        route 10.0.0.0/24 via 10.0.1.254;
    }

    # Faucet bgp peer config.
    # Will import all routes available, including the static ones above.
    protocol bgp faucet {
        local as 64513;
        neighbor 10.0.1.4 port 9179 as 64512;
        export all;
        import all;
    }

Start BIRD

.. code:: console
    as_ns hostgw bird

We'll configure Faucet by adding the BGP configuration to the br1-gw VLAN.

.. code:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/faucet/faucet.yaml

    vlans:
        br1-hosts:
            vid: 100
            description: "h1 & h2's vlan"
            faucet_mac: "00:00:00:00:00:11"
            faucet_vips: ["10.0.0.254/24"]

        br1-gw:
            vid: 200
            description: "vlan for peering port"
            faucet_mac: "00:00:00:00:00:22"
            faucet_vips: ["10.0.1.254/24"]
            bgp_port: 9179                          # BGP port for Faucet to listen on.
            bgp_as: 64512                           # Faucet's AS number
            bgp_routerid: '10.0.1.2'                # Faucet's Unique ID.
            bgp_neighbor_addresses: ['10.0.1.3']    # Neighbouring IP addresses (IPv4/IPv6)
            bgp_connect_mode: active                #
            bgp_neighbor_as: 64513                  # Neighbour's AS number

    routers:
        br1-router:
            vlans: [br1-hosts, br1-gw]

And finally add the port configuration for the Faucet dataplane interface (veth-faucet0).

.. code:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/faucet/facuet.yaml

    dps:
        br1:
            ...
            interfaces:
                ...
                4:
                    name: "faucet-dataplane"
                    description: "faucet's dataplane connection for bgp"
                    native_vlan: br1-gw

Now restart Faucet.

.. code:: console

    sudo systemctl restart faucet


and our logs should show us 'BGP peer router *** up'.

.. code:: log
    :caption: /var/log/faucet/faucet.log

    ...
    May 04 19:17:55 faucet INFO     BGP peer router ID 10.0.1.3 AS 64513 up
    May 04 19:17:55 faucet ERROR    BGP nexthop 10.0.1.254 for prefix 10.0.0.0/24 cannot be us
    May 04 19:17:55 faucet INFO     BGP add 192.168.1.0/24 nexthop 10.0.1.3

Now we should be able to ping from host1 to hostgw.

.. code:: console

    as_ns host1 ping 10.0.1.3
    PING 10.0.1.3 (10.0.1.3) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 10.0.1.3: icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=0.404 ms
    64 bytes from 10.0.1.3: icmp_seq=4 ttl=63 time=0.128 ms
